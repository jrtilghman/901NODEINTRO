# Chapter 3 Practice with NPM global

## Objectives:
* You will use NPM to install packages globally.

## Steps

1. Navigate to a command window any location, because we are talking about global installs. You can use the shortcut control + ` to bring up the integrated terminal.

1. Use the `npm ls -g` command to see what has already been installed globally. Scroll through the file to get a sense of the structure.

1. The first entry is a package called `knex`. Knex allows your projects to connect to databases. You really should only install globally tools which your projects donâ€™t depend on.  

1. You can also run this command to see if something in particular is installed globally.

    ``` npm -g ls knex ```

1. Remove the knex from being available globally by using this command:
    ``` npm -g rm knex ```

    an alternative command is:
    ``` npm -g uninstall knex ```


1. Hit the up arrows to go back and try to list the global entry from knex - it should now be gone (listed as -- (empty))
